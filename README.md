### 🚀 Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the dataset with detailed visualizations.  
- **Preprocessing:** Handles imbalanced datasets using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE).  
- **Feature Engineering:** Selects key features to optimize model performance.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for fraud detection.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Utilizes precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve for performance evaluation.
